# Company Context

Standalone company-context ingestion service. It indexes regular Google Docs and text-bearing PDFs from users' My Drive, shared folders, Shared Drives they are members of, and Shared Drive folders shared with them without membership, using durable Absurd tasks. Google Docs are exported as plain text through the Drive API before chunking. Each user corpus and each member Shared Drive is followed through its own Drive change feed and checkpoint. Shared Drive folders shared with non-members have no change feed, so they are walked recursively each cycle, and files no walk has reached for 24 hours are removed.

It also indexes Granola meeting notes, including transcripts when the user's Granola plan provides them, through each user's Granola MCP OAuth credential. Each sync lists the account's meetings from its checkpoint onward, fetches details and transcripts ten meetings at a time, and republishes a note only when its content changes. Notes that no live Granola credential still observes are removed.

The service owns these Postgres schemas:

- `company_context_system`: private cursors, staging, and processing state.
- `company_context_data`: retrieval-facing Drive documents and Granola notes, access observations, and embeddings.

The `centaur_company_context_reader` role used by the company-context tool can read `google_drive_documents` and `google_drive_document_embeddings`. Row-level security limits each reader to files that a live broker credential with the same Google subject (`centaur.google_subject`) still observes; `google_drive_broker_observations` is the only source of that access. The reader cannot query the observations or the system schema directly. The reader has no access to Granola notes yet. The Helm deployment is gated by `experimentalCompanyContext.enabled` until it is ready for production.

## Required infrastructure

- Postgres with the existing Absurd schema and the `vector` and `pg_search` extensions available.
- `pdftotext` from Poppler (for PDF sources).
- A Rails Console database containing live per-user Google and Granola OAuth broker credentials.
- The Active Record encryption primary key and derivation salt used by Rails Console.
- An embeddings API key supplied through a Kubernetes Secret.

## Configuration

Every setting is available as both a command-line option and an environment
variable. Command-line options take precedence; run
`centaur-company-context --help` for the complete list.

Required:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `IRON_CONTROL_DATABASE_URL`
- `IRON_CONTROL_AR_ENCRYPTION_PRIMARY_KEY`
- `IRON_CONTROL_AR_ENCRYPTION_KEY_DERIVATION_SALT`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

The service discovers live per-user broker credentials belonging to the Google
OAuth app selected by `COMPANY_CONTEXT_GOOGLE_OAUTH_APP_SLUG` (default
`google`). Rails Console owns refreshing those tokens; the service decrypts the
current access token before each Drive request. Granola broker credentials are
selected the same way by `COMPANY_CONTEXT_GRANOLA_OAUTH_APP_SLUG` (default
`granola`). Drive requests honor `Retry-After`
on rate limits and retry server errors with bounded exponential backoff. Durable
document tasks record known permanent content and request failures as `rejected`
instead of retrying them. A credential reconciliation task deactivates
observations from dead or deleted broker credentials and removes files only when
no live user credential can still observe them. Each scan interval also lists
every credential's Shared Drives and the Shared Drive items shared with it,
enqueues a scan per member drive, starts a folder walk per other drive, and revokes
that credential's access to files in drives it can no longer reach. A folder
walk runs as one Absurd task per batch of folders: each batch lists its
folders' children in a single Drive search and spawns batches for the
subfolders. The Helm deployment reads
`OPENAI_API_KEY` directly from the shared Kubernetes Secret.

Common optional settings:

- `IRON_CONTROL_DATABASE_NAME`
- `COMPANY_CONTEXT_GOOGLE_OAUTH_APP_SLUG` (default `google`)
- `COMPANY_CONTEXT_GRANOLA_OAUTH_APP_SLUG` (default `granola`)
- `BIND_ADDR` (default `0.0.0.0:8080`)
- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_BASE_URL`
- `GRANOLA_MCP_URL` (default `https://mcp.granola.ai/mcp`)
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL`
- `COMPANY_CONTEXT_SCAN_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default `300`)
- `COMPANY_CONTEXT_GRANOLA_SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default `1800`)
- `COMPANY_CONTEXT_GRANOLA_INITIAL_LOOKBACK_DAYS` (default `365`)
- `COMPANY_CONTEXT_DRIVE_PAGE_SIZE` (default `100`)
- `COMPANY_CONTEXT_MAX_SCAN_PAGES` (default `10`)
- `COMPANY_CONTEXT_FOLDER_WALK_BATCH_SIZE` (default `50`, at most `100`)
- `COMPANY_CONTEXT_MAX_PDF_BYTES` (default `26214400`)
- `COMPANY_CONTEXT_MAX_EXTRACTED_BYTES` (default `52428800`; also limits exported Google Doc text)
- `COMPANY_CONTEXT_EXTRACTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default `120`)
- `COMPANY_CONTEXT_CHUNK_CHARS` (default `6000`)
- `COMPANY_CONTEXT_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` (default `4`)
- `COMPANY_CONTEXT_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL` (default `text-embedding-3-small`)
- `COMPANY_CONTEXT_EMBEDDINGS_DIMENSIONS` (currently required to be `1536`)

## Backfilling newly supported Drive file types

To discover existing files after adding a supported Drive MIME type, stop the
company-context workers and run:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" --file scripts/reset_drive_checkpoints.sql
```

Restart the workers afterward. This resets only Drive scan cursors. The fresh
metadata scan does not enqueue extraction for unchanged files, so previously
indexed PDFs are not downloaded again.

## Endpoints

- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /readyz`
- `GET /metrics`

## Development

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
```
